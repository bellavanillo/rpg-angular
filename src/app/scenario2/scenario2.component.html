  scenario2 works!

You clean the zebras' enclosure, but by the time you go to feed the lions they're starving! One of the lions bites your hand off, and your boss is not very happy with you, you lose 5 points.

You have some free time and want to go look at your two favorite animals, giraffes and rhinos. But you only have time to visit one, which do you choose?
